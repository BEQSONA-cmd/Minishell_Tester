# Minishell Tester
Minishell Tester is a convenient tool designed to simplify testing your minishell. It establishes a connection between two terminals, allowing you to simultaneously execute commands in both your minishell and the standard bash shell.

## Installation

for install the Minishell tester please run this command:
```bash
cd && git clone https://github.com/BEQSONA-cmd/Minishell_Tester.git && cd Minishell_Tester && ./install.sh
```
## How it works: 
#### Run 'reallyshell' in one terminal to start a session that executes commands in bash and prints the output.
```bash
reallyshell
```

#### Run 'm_test' in a second terminal to launch your minishell. [ run in directory where the Makefile is allocated ]
```bash
m_test
```

### The two terminals are now connected. Commands typed in the terminal running 'Reallyshell' will be executed in both the bash shell and your minishell, making it easy to compare their outputs.
